# PredictingCostumerChurn-MachineLearning-Project
In this project, Data visulization of Churn_Modelling Dataset with Prediction of costumer churn is performed in Python.
For developing the Machine Learning model Scikit-Learn module is used. The model used in this project is Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) for prediction of costumer churn.
For Data Visualization and Analysis Pandas,Seaborn and Matplotlib modules are used.
